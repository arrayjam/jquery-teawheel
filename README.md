# jQuery Wheelgame fork

This fork is attempting to make the demo a little more functional.

Added so far:
 * Rudimentary touch support
 * A readme with text in it
 * Better colours (Not dynamic yet)
 * Text colours based on luminance of background colour (dynamically set)
 * Text size adjusts based on length of title
 * Text rotates with wheel
 * Spin button accelerates rather than setting speed
 * Adding items manually

Plans:
 * Add more controls
 * Polish design further
     * Building with intent for iPad usage
 * Add arrow indicator of where results are sourced from
 * Move to jQuery 1.7.x (Doesn't currently work correctly - spinning ignores input)
