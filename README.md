# jQuery Tea Wheel

A web-app for choosing what tea to have from my roommate's extensive inventory.

## Added so far
* Better colours (Not dynamic yet)
* Text colours based on luminance of background colour (dynamically set)
* Text size adjusts based on length of title
* Text rotates with wheel
* Spin button accelerates rather than setting speed
* Adding items manually
* Arrow shows where winning item is
* Moved to jQuery 1.7

## Plans
* Enhance interface controls
* Polish design further
    * Building with intent for iPad usage
* Manipulate tea metadata
* Display tea label colours on wheel
* Save teas to LocalStorage
* Removing items
